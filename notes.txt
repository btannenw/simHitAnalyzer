[DONE] email fabio and massimo about patches for D35 in 10_4_0_pre2 --> for getting global coordinates

lindsey will send me thing for integrating part2 in 10_4_0

ETL
[DONE] - local x (along global Phi), local y (along global R), local z (along global Z)

BTL
- energy cut on sim-hit --> corners should "go away" as one approaches MIP peak
[DONE] - BTLDetID .modType (?) --> split Z plot in those three categories
[temp] - convert all this crap to cm via code snippet that Lindsey sent
[DONE] - local y (along global Z), local x (along global Phi), local z (along global R)
- split local X plot by module type and see. peaks at end due to hits shared on edge between bars
